# About
<p> This is the first ever program I built from scratch! It's part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course.<p>
<p> It's a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors played against the computer. First to score 5 wins.

# Update
<p> I've added a simple GUI. As a complete noob learning web dev for the first time and following TOP's curriculum, I have very limited knowledge of responsive web design. I tried my best to fix some of the layout issues I knew how to fix but I know there are still some left, especially when it comes to viewing this from mobile devices. I'll revisit it later on to fix these issues. </p>

<p> Concepts I learned and applied while making this:<p>
    <ul>
        <li> Query selectors </li>
        <li> Adding and removing classes to trigger certain styles </li>
        <li> Event listeners </li>
        <li> Using rem, em, %, vh, vw, max, and min sizes instead of using px for everything </li>
        <li> Preventing default event behavior </li>
        <li> Adding an overlay </li>
    </ul>
        
# Original project (Console Only)
<p> It's a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors played entirely on the console. The game stops after 5 rounds. No GUI yet but I will modify and update this in the future.
<p> Concepts I learned and applied while making this:
<ul>
    <li> For loops, breaks </li>
    <li> Custom functions </li>
    <li> Conditionals </li>
    <li> Arrays, how to generate a random choice from an array </li>
    <li> Getting user input via prompt </li>
    <li> Alerts </li>
</ul>
<p> A lot of these are concepts I've encountered for the first time so I had to figure them out as I went.
<p> I realized just how important it really is to have a well thought-out plan before starting to actually write code. Figuring out the algorithm first and writing it in pseudocode has been really useful for me when I made this. I'll also start utilizing comments to explain why I did certain things.
