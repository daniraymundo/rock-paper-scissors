# About
<p> This is the first JavaScript program I built from scratch ever. It's part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course.
<p> It's a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors played entirely on the console. No GUI yet but I will modify and update this in the future.
<p> Concepts I learned and applied while making this:
<ul>
    <li> For loops, breaks </li>
    <li> Custom functions </li>
    <li> Conditionals </li>
    <li> Arrays, how to generate a random choice from an array </li>
    <li> Getting user input via prompt </li>
    <li> Alerts </li>
</ul>
<p> A lot of these are concepts I've encountered for the first time so I had to figure them out as I went.
<p> I realized just how important it really is to have a well thought-out plan before starting to actually write code. Figuring out the algorithm first and writing it in pseudocode has been really useful for me when I made this. I'll also start utilizing comments to explain why I did certain things.
